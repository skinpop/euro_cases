fusion360 design files for my eurorack cases

Screw holes for the rails are specific to the rails with end brackets sold by [Clicks & Clocks](https://clicksclocks.de/). 
Make sure to modify the files to fit your rails before starting a build!

The 9u case was designed to house a [Trogotronic m15](https://www.trogotronic.com/product/m15/) power solution. If you intend to build this case make sure you understand the requirements of your power solution of choice and update the design accordingly.
